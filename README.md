# 🐍 Python Snake Game
A classic Snake Game built using Python's `turtle` module. Move the snake, eat the food, and try to get the highest score! Built as part of my Python learning journey.

## 📌 Features
- Snake movement with arrow keys
- Food appears in random positions
- Scoreboard that updates dynamically
- Game over message when you collide
- Clean, minimal design

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Run the game**  
   Use your terminal or IDE run command: `python main.py`
2. **Controls**
   - ⬆ Up Arrow – Move up  
   - ⬇ Down Arrow – Move down  
   - ⬅ Left Arrow – Move left  
   - ➡ Right Arrow – Move right  
3. Eat the food to increase your score.  
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or your own tail.
